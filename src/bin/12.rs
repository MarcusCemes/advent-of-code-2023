/// So... I had to look this one up. I'm not ashamed to admit it.
/// It turns out that brute-forcing this problem is not a good idea.
///
/// Instead, we can use a "dynamic programming" approach to solve it,
/// by intelligently considering a single spring and exploring the state
/// space of possible arrangements, pruning whole subtrees of possibilities
/// that violate the group constraints.
///
/// The algorithm works by considering each spring in turn, starting with a single
/// branch (defined by a `group` index and current spring `length`). For each
/// step, we iterative over all stored branches and consider whether the spring is
/// working broken.
///
/// If it's working, we complete the previous broken spring (if there is one) by
/// incrementing the `group` index (to start searching for the next group). If it's
/// broken, we extend the `length` counter, or drop the branch if it exceeds the
/// current group constraint. In the case that the spring is unknown, we do both
/// (an unknown spring effectively splits our decision tree in two, it creates two
/// valid configurations). At the end of the algorithm, we finalise each branch
/// (filter those that found all groups correctly) and sum their permutations.
///
/// To reuse computation, we can regroup branches that have the same `group` and
/// `length`. For this, we introduce a `permutations` counter which represents the
/// number of paths leading to this state (like roads rejoining, before they split again).
///
/// The result is that you can compute 850.5 trillion valid spring configurations
/// in about 15 Î¼s. Definitely worth it. Algorithm inspired by u/KayZGames on
/// Reddit (https://redd.it/18gomx5)
